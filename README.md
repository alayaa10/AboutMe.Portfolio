# AboutMe.Portfolio
This is my portfolio giving a bit of a deeper dive into knowing me and some of the projects i've completed on my tech journey.
I touched base on HTML and CSS. Helping me develop a better intake on when and how to use my commands, etc. 
This is sort of what I would call a step stool of getting better at my code.
I didnt quiet exactly do this whole format on my own, getting some help from video of youtube and w3schools.
